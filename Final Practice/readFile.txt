When to start a new paragraph:

Start new main points or new ideas in a new paragraph. If you have an extended idea across multiple paragraphs, each new point within that idea should have its own paragraph.
Use a new paragraph to introduce a contrasting or different position. Use a clear topic sentence to identify the main idea.
If the paragraph becomes too long or the material is overly complex, you will need to create a break to make your writing more readable. Try splitting long paragraphs into two shorter paragraphs. This means you will need to write a new topic sentence at the start of the new paragraph.
Introductions and conclusions are usually written as separate paragraphs.
